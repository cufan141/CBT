### Ethical and Safety Risks

- **Inadequate crisis handling** – AI suggestions may be incorrect or delayed, especially in high-risk scenarios, and must never replace emergency services.
- **Deceptive empathy** – Chatbots can appear empathic without real accountability, which is risky with vulnerable users.
- **Bias and inequity** – Performance differences across language styles, cultures, or demographics may cause unfair treatment.
- **Privacy and surveillance** – Continuous monitoring of sensitive mental health content raises serious concerns about consent, data security, and misuse.
