## Peer Assessment Reflection

My peer assessment is difficult because I went from having three team members to just me and one other person for a couple of weeks. Then I was put in another group who didn’t respond, so I finally had to do everything myself.

I would say that deep learning and computer vision were my favorite topics to learn about. I also enjoyed the Python exercise and the statistics exercise.

If I had more time, I would definitely try to work on the final more consistently and spread the effort out over the course.
