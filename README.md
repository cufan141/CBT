# MindAlign: Proactive Mental Health Support App

# Project Overview

MindAlign is a mobile application designed to provide proactive support to users struggling with **mental health, addiction, or similar challenges**. The core innovation lies in using **AI-driven check-ins** and **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** principles to detect crisis situations and facilitate immediate, defined support should AI detect.

### The Idea
An app that checks in with users at intervals throughout the day. It uses sentiment analysis and CBT principles during these chats to detect if a user is in crisis and can reach out to a **user-defined support team**.

### Problem Statement
People in a mental health crisis are the ones who most rarely ask for help. MindAlign provides a channel where help can be initiated proactively.

### Product Concept
AI is applied during chats with the user. The goal is to **replace negative thoughts with more realistic and rational ones**. This approach is designed to lead to:
* Improved mood and emotional regulation.
* Reinforcement of positive behavior.
