### Technical Limitations

- **False negatives** – The system can miss subtle or culturally specific expressions of distress or suicidality, leading to under-escalation.
- **False positives** – Over-flagging can cause unnecessary anxiety and “alert fatigue,” where users or staff start ignoring notifications.
- **Domain shift** – Models trained on Reddit or other public data may not generalize to short mobile check-ins or different user populations without careful validation.
- **Limited context** – Single-message classification often fails to interpret sarcasm, long-term patterns, or references to past events.
